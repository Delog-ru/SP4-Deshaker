# SP4 Deshaker
Many Surface Pro 4 tablets have a screen shaking problem. Faulty devices flickering and shaking when screen isn't updating. One of the possible solutions is to have something always updating on the screen. SP4 Deshaker is a simple app with the only purpose to update its tray icon every half second.

There are no official fix for screen shaking problem. Microsoft just exchanges faulty devices if your warranty is valid.

Download app from "[Releases](https://github.com/Delog-ru/SP4-Deshaker/releases)" tab or build it yourself from sources.
