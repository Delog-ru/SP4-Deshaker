# SP4 Deshaker
Many Surface Pro 4 tablets have a screen shaking problem. Faulty devices flickering and shaking when screen isn't updating. One of the possible solutions is to have something always updating on the screen. SP4 Deshaker is a simple app with the only purpose to update its tray icon every half second.

There are no official fix for screen shaking problem. Microsoft just exchanges faulty devices if your warranty is valid.

Download app from "[Releases](https://github.com/Delog-ru/SP4-Deshaker/releases)" tab or build it yourself from sources.

# Update
Alas! The more you use your faulty Surface the worse it gets. After two weeks screen shaking became more severe and this program doesn't help. Known facts so far:
* Only Surface Pro 4 has this screen defect;
* There's no official fix for this;
* Every day you start with low shaking which this program can fix but the longer you use your device the more severe shaking and flickering will be. I use mine for 6+ hours per day and after that it renders completely unusable;
* Temperature is not an issue. Shaking and flickering appears even if CPU temperature is under 40C and Surface's body is not hot;
* The more severe flickering the more screen updates you need to stop it but sometimes even full screen video won't stop shaking;
* You can plug external display via mini display port and it works perfecly.
